Server inconsistencies like server overload and server shutdowns are very common in a webserver specially at peak times. *A Local Network Load Balancer for MSU-CICS Webserver* is a project that was created in the response of server inconsistency in the college's servers. It vastly decreases the server overload of a server and backup servers almost always removes server shutdowns from happening. Scalability is a huge advantage that this project has as well, servers can be easily added when the servers starting to overload due to multiple requests.The load balancer implemented in MSU CICS is a system designed to distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers in a manner that maximizes resource utilization and minimizes response time. This system utilizes a variety of load balancing algorithms and techniques to achieve its objectives, including round-robin scheduling, weighted round-robin scheduling, and least connections scheduling. This load balancer has been tested and validated in real-world scenarios and has proven to be an effective solution for managing high traffic volumes while maintaining optimal server performance.
